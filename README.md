# Awesome Roller Derby
A curated list of open source awesome things related to roller derby.
To be part of this list, projects and software must have an open license.

### What is an open licence?
An open license allows anyone ot reuse the content, if it's a software it could be open source licence (GPL, MIT, etc.) and if it's some other content, then using a free redistribution license (CC-BY-SA, used by Wikipedia, etc.).

### Why is an open license important?
Open license allows redistribution of content, and ultimately, this will help roller derby grow!
Another consequence is that when the creator of the content disappear or stops distributing it, other people can still do it!
It also allows other people to build on the work, in the same way we're all standing on the shoulders of our ancestors.

### There is some other content which is not open out there.
True. It can also be awesome, but less awesome. :)
