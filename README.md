### What is an open licence?
An open license allows anyone ot reuse the content, if it's a software it could be open source licence (GPL, MIT, etc.) and if it's some other content, then using a free redistribution license (CC-BY-SA, used by Wikipedia, etc.).

Another consequence is that when the creator of the content disappear or stops distributing it, other people can still do it!
